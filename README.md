# xfloat
Extended precision floats

Disclaimer: This is for personal testing and understanding of extended precision floats. It is basicly a reimplementation of the cephes qfloat library.
So I say it again, this is for personal use and if you want to do anything serious with it, then please grab the qfloat library from netlib.org (http://www.netlib.org/cephes/).
